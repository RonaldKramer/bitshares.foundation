# Vision

Make Bitshares a number one choice for the crypto community which provides a secure and easy way for traders of all levels to buy and sell digital assets online.

# Worker Intent

## Design Goals

We plan to develop a new version of Bitshares Exchange and improve the related tools to become more: 

* **Useful**- The Exchange should enable users to perform specific tasks by providing the needed tools to do so
* **Usable**- The new UI should be easy to use and understand by non-trained users. Key tasks, current status, and next steps must be apparent to the user
* **Intuitive**- It should be obvious for users where they are within the platform and the following steps required to perform a task
* **Fully Responsive**- The UI should be responsive for DT, tablets, smartphones

## Technical Goals

* **Light & Responsive**- Light and optimized front-end code that adopts to various screen sizes
* **Framewok Update**- Update to the latest React-Js v16.4. components. This would ensure a UI that is fast, responsive, and gentle on device resources
* **Latest Technologies**- Adoption of the new Harmony (ES6-7) of ECMAScript language specification would minimize the codebase and optimizes the performance
* **Easy to Maintain**- a Component-based approach that is easy to maintain and expand will minimize maintenance and support resources

# Collaboration Framework

We are using Jira management system to ensure full transparency and accountability of the project development. 

* **Weekly Sprints**- Project stakeholders will be able to access weekly sprints with user stories, a list of tasks, status updates and reports. 
* **Real-time collaboration**with the project stakeholders via Telegram or Slack. 
* **Milestone–based process**presentations and QA sessions. 
* **Public beta**testing

# Development Process
We employ Agile Scrum Methodology which has garnered increasing popularity in the agile software development community due to its simplicity and proven productivity. Fast moving, cutting-edge developments can be quickly coded and tested using this method, as a mistake can be easily rectified. Frequent updates make it easy to monitor the project development.
The overhead cost in terms of process and management is minimal thus leading to a quicker, cheaper result. Due to short sprints and constant feedback, it becomes easier to address immediate user feedback and test ideas.

# Initial Development Plan

## Project Milestones

The project is intended to start in october, with a month of buffer incorporated.

### 1st month

* DESIGN - Research

  At this stage, ROSSUL will work closely with BitShares stakeholders to gather project specifications and establish critical success factors. We will begin the process by interviewing stakeholders either as a group or individually. At this stage, it is imperative that we ask the right questions and collect our data in an unbiased manner.

* DESIGN - Information Architecture

  We will create a structure for the application that allows users to understand where they are, and where the information they want is in relation to their position. This will result in the creation of site maps, hierarchies, categorizations, navigation.

* DESIGN - Desktop Layout Wireframes

  At this stage, ROSSUL will work closely with BitShares stakeholders to gather project specifications and establish critical success factors. We will begin the process by interviewing stakeholders as a group or individually. At this stage, it is just as important that we are able to ask the right questions and collect our data in an unbiased manner.

### 2nd month

* DESIGN - Mobile Wireframes

  This is the most effective way to visualize the data structure and represent UI features. It enables effective communication between team members and, more importantly, allows for early testing of workflows, navigation, and overall layouts.

* DESIGN - User Testing

  Implement proof-of-concept and plugins integration functions

* DEVELOPMENT - Estimating workload

  Architecture and planning stages of development. The study of the internal features of the code base and the search for solutions for the implementation of more optimized and qualitative product.

### 3rd-4th month

* DESIGN - Look & Feel Design

  Implement proof-of-concept and plugins integration functions

* DEVELOPMENT - Implementation of primary interfaces

  Creation of interactive mockups from static ones, testing interactive mockups for the quality of User Experience, iterative improvements to visual and UX design.

* DEVELOPMENT - Transfer an existing project

  Inclusion of existing functionality, binding and uploading current data from the blockchain, working with the output of static information.

### 4th-5th month

* DEVELOPMENT - Development of new functionality

  Adding opportunities to work with stealth transactions, improving and finalizing already implemented solutions in order to improve the quality of the product.

* DEVELOPMENT - Documentation
  Create documentation and API for community use as well as for the expansion and development of the platform.

### Code Handover and overlap period

To simplify the onboarding and code handover we expect some overlap time with the current UI team. This is a standard process that reduces the risk of setback and keeps the development velocity constant. The process facilitates direct information exchange between engineers and designers, brings the current UI team onboard the app’s code and architecture, provides support for the current UI team when specific information is needed. 

  **Estimated time:** 100 hours/team ($25,000 total).
  *If less time is required, the allocated funds will be distributed back to the community.*

### Support

We will provide support services and assistance to maintain and update the aforementioned deliverables, including correcting any errors or deficiencies during the first 60 days following the final delivery (Warranty period). “Support Services” means technical support and assistance to maintain and update the front-end source code Deliverables, including correcting any errors or Deficiencies, but shall not include new development, enhancements, or features, or other services outside the scope of the Proposal. 

Additional time above following expiration of Warranty Period shall be billed at the regular hourly rate ($150/h design and 120/h code realted tasks) and require a new worker proposal.
